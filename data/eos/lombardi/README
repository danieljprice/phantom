The data tables for the equation of state and opacities for the modified Lombardi radiative cooling approximation are too large to be stored in the Phantom git repository.
They will be downloaded automatically when you run the code

or can be retrieved manually using wget from Zenodo, e.g.:

wget https://zenodo.org/records/13842491/files/eos_lom.dat

The files are:
