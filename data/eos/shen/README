The Shen equation of state data tables are too large to be stored in the Phantom git repository
They will be downloaded automatically when you run the code

or can be retrieved manually using wget from the phantom website, e.g.:

wget http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/phantom/data/eos/shen/eos_binary_table.dat

The files are:

eos_binary_table.dat
