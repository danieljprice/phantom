Use this directory to store *small* but essential data files
that are necessary for certain Phantom configurations to work
properly.

These data files are not meant to be comprehensive, but merely
to allow Phantom to run without relying on unknown external data.

Each directory should contain a README file describing the data
format, its purpose, and which Phantom module(s) it is used by

** They should mostly be SMALL ASCII FILES. Please DO NOT add large 
binary files to this directory as they will bloat the repository **

** Please also avoid adding multiple versions of the same file **

IF IN DOUBT, ASK FIRST
