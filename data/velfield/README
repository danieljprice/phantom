The velfield data tables are too large to be stored in the Phantom git repository
They will be downloaded automatically when you run the code

or can be retrieved manually using wget from the phantom website, e.g.:

wget http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/phantom/data/velfield/cube_v1.dat

The files are:
cube_v1.dat
cube_v2.dat
cube_v3.dat

These files contain realisations of a curl-free turbulent velocity field
as used in the Bate, Bonnell & Bromm (2003) star cluster formation calculations.

This velocity field is defined on a fixed grid and interpolated
to SPH particles during the initial conditions procedure (src/setup/setup_cluster.f90)
