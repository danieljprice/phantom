# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
name: mpi

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # do not run it if [skip ci] appears in the commit message
    if: "! contains(toJSON(github.event.commits.*.message), '[skip ci]')"
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
