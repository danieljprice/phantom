> The Phantom Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code

About
-----

Phantom is a 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics code for astrophysics. It was written and developed by Daniel Price with contributions from many others (see AUTHORS). It is designed to be a fast 3D SPH code with a low memory footprint, for production runs. It is not a code for testing algorithms (use NDSPMHD instead).
