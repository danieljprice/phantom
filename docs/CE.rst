How to set up and run a common envelope binary simulation
=========================================================

Polytropic star + sink companion
--------------------------------

Use SETUP=star and if not specified, the default options.

::

   1.1 $PHANTOM_DIR/scripts/writemake.sh star > Makefile

**A. setup the polytropic star**

::

  1.2 make setup
  1.3 ./phantomsetup poly (option 2 Polytrope, number of particles = 1000, Relax star automatically = yes)
  1.4 vim  poly.setup, (write_rho_to_file = T)

  1.5 ./phantomsetup poly.setup
  1.6 make
  1.7 vim poly.in (to change values like tmax=500.00, dtmax=50.00 and nfulldump = 1)
  1.8 ./phantom poly.in


**B. include a sink particle inside the polytropic star**

::

  1.9  make moddump
  1.10 ./phantommoddump poly_00002 core_00000.tmp 0.0 (option 4, mass core = 0.01, hsoft = 0.1).
       Replace poly_00002 by the best-suited outcome of step 1.8.
  1.11 vim core.in (optional to change values like tmax or dtmax)
  1.12 ./phantom core.in


**C. Setup the binary system**

::

  1.13 ./phantommoddump core_00002 binary_00000.tmp 0.0
       (option 1, companion mass = 0.4, orbital separation = 0.8, softening length for companion = 0.1)
  1.14 vim binary.in (optional, tmax=200.00, dtmax=0.100)
  1.15 ./phantom binary.in


**D. Analysis**

::

  1.16 make analysis
  1.17 ./phantomanalysis binary_000* (option 1, corotating frame? No)
       This step is made to obtain the orbital parameters of the binary system in the file separation_vs_time.ev
  1.18 splash separation_vs_time.ev


Real star model
---------------

Use SETUP=star or SETUP=dustystar and if not specified, the default options.

::


   2.1 $PHANTOM_DIR/scripts/writemake.sh star > Makefile


**A. setup the MESA model**

::

  2.2 make setup
  2.3 ./phantomsetup star (option 5 MESA star, input profile = Jan_Star_Phantom_Profile.data, desired EOS = 10,
      use constant entropy profile, Relax star automatically = yes). The core radius is the softening radius (2-3Ro)
      the core mass is the same as the one you have measured from MESA (0.46Mo in Jan_Star_Phantom_Profile).
      This produces a file called star.setup - this file has all the options so you can edit it.
  2.4 vim  star.setup, (write_rho_to_file = T)
Relaxation

::

  2.5 ./phantomsetup star.setup : this will run the relaxation. The relaxation does not always lead to a great
      result. You will have to test it. This run will produce a star_00000.tmp and a star.in
  2.6 make
  2.7 vim star.in (to change values like tmax=500.00, dtmax=5.00 and nfulldump = 1)
  2.8 ./phantom star.in. Run phantom on this tmp star for ~5 tau_dyn and check it. This means comparing the density
      profile with the original file. Ensuring that most of the particles (at least 95%) have low velocities (low
      compared to the orbital one, surface sound speed, velocity that crosses the star in the simulation time...
      you can determine what your threshold is).
  2.9 make analysis : option 6, Star stabilisation suite.
      This measures the radius of the star over time, using a couple of criteria: 1) The radius of the photospheric
      density at time zero 2) the average radius of a number of particles that are the farthest from the centre,
      but excluding the farthest 5% ...
 2.10 If you are happy with your star (e.g model star_00200) you can compile and run moddump to add a sink at the
      star's center and set the binary system.


**B. Add a sink at the center of the MESA star**

Note that if you use Jan_Star_Phantom_Profile a sink particle is already present in the core so go directly to step **C**

Same procedure as with the polytropes (1.9 -> 1.12)

::


  2.11 make moddump
  2.12 ./phantommoddump star_00200 core_00000.tmp 0.0 (option 4, mass core = 0.01, hsoft = 0.1).
       Replace star_00200 by the best-suited outcome of step 2.8.
  2.13 vim core.in (you may need to adapt tmax or dtmax)
  2.14 ./phantom core.in


**C. Setup the binary system**

if you come from 2.10, then use as initial model (hereafter initial_nnnnn) one of the star_nnnnn files else one of the core_kkkkk models

::


  2.15 ./phantommoddump initial_nnnnn binary_00000.tmp 0.0
       (option 1, companion mass = 0.6, orbital separation = 100., accretion radius for the primary core = 1.,
        softening length for the primary core = 1., softening length for companion = 0.1)
  2.16 vim binary.in (optional, tmax=200.00, dtmax=0.100)
  2.17 ./phantom binary.in
