Programming in Fortran
=======================

Phantom is written in `modern Fortran <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran>`_, following the latest standards. We enforce at minimum the Fortran 2008 standard at compile time.

Fortran is a language designed for scientific and high performance computing. Unless your department or faculty specialises in this area your background may be scratchy. To get you started, I have put together several introductory tutorials on the very basics of coding in Fortran.

- `Introductory Fortran tutorials - YouTube playlist <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMzuj51UjsPTZjHd6XKB4PYbqYDsEBKwH>`_

- `Introduction to modern Fortran <http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/teaching/fortran/lab-Fortran.pdf>`_ (pdf tutorial to accompany YouTube videos)

- `A simple Fortran Primer <http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/teaching/fortran/FortranPrimer.pdf>`_ (very basic introduction to Fortran syntax)

- `Version control with git + advanced Fortran tutorial <http://users.monash.edu.au/~dprice/teaching/fortran/lab-Fortran-adv.pdf>`_ (introduces git and some higher level Fortran concepts, including basics of openMP parallelisation)

 If you are still missing large chunks of your education, let me know.
