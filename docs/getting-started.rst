Getting started
===============

Phantom is a fast, parallel, modular and low-memory smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics code in three dimensions written in Fortran. It was developed for astrophysical applications `(read the paper) <http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASA...35...31P>`__.

Quickstart
----------

1. :doc:`Get a copy <gitinfo>` of the code.

2. Make your :doc:`first calculation <running-first-calculation>`.

3. Understand how the code works (:doc:`Fortree <fortree>` may help).

4. Run your simulations :doc:`on a cluster <running-clusters>` and make cool science.

5. Please cite the `code paper <http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PASA...35...31P>`__ and other relevant papers in your publications.
