Phantom is a 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics code
for astrophysics. It was written and developed by Daniel Price with contributions
from many others (see AUTHORS). It is designed to be a fast 3D SPH code with a
low memory footprint, for production runs. It is not a code for testing
algorithms (use NDSPMHD instead).

See LICENCE file for usage and distribution conditions.
